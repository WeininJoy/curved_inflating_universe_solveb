# BICEP2/Keck Array likelihood, including external data from Planck and WMAP.
# 
# This file contains input parameters to CosmoMC to reproduce the likelihoods 
# of the alternate analysis shown as the red line on Figure 18 of 
# BICEP/Keck XIII. This likelihood differs from the baseline because it allows
# decorrelation of the dust signal with a uniform prior on parameter Delta_d,
# limited to the range [0.2,1], and linear scaling with ell. For details of the 
# parameters in the baseline model, see BK18lfonly.ini and BK18lf.ini, and 
# comments therein.
#
# After generating chains, BK18_07_BK18lf_freebdust_dclin_dist.ini can be used 
# with getdist to produce plots of marginalized posteriors.
