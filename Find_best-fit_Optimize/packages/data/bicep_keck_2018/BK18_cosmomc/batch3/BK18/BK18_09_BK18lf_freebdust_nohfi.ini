# BICEP2/Keck Array likelihood, including external data from Planck and WMAP.
#
# This file contains input parameters to CosmoMC to reproduce the likelihoods 
# of the alternate analysis shown as the green line on Figure 21 of 
# BICEP/Keck XIII. This likelihood differs from the baseline because it does not
# include data from Planck HFI maps (but still includes Planck LFI and
# WMAP 23 and 33 GHz). For details of the parameters in the baseline model, 
# see BK18lfonly.ini and BK18lf.ini, and comments therein.
#
# After generating chains, BK18_09_BK18lf_freebdust_nohfi_dist.ini can be used 
# with getdist to produce plots of marginalized posteriors.
