# BICEP2/Keck Array likelihood, including external data from Planck and WMAP.
#
# This file contains input parameters to CosmoMC to reproduce the likelihoods 
# of the alternate analysis shown as the cyan line on Figure 21 of 
# BICEP/Keck XIII. This likelihood differs from the baseline because it does not
# include data from Planck LFI maps and WMAP 23 and 33 GHz maps (but still 
# includes Planck HFI maps). For details of the parameters in the baseline model, 
# see BK18lfonly.ini and BK18lf.ini, and comments therein.
#
# After generating chains, BK18_12_BK18lf_freebdust_bkhfi_dist.ini can be used with 
# getdist to produce plots of marginalized posteriors.
