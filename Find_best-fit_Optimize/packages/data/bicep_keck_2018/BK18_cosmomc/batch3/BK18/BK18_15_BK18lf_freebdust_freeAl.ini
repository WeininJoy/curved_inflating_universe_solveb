# BICEP2/Keck Array likelihood, including external data from Planck and WMAP.
#
# This file contains input parameters to CosmoMC to reproduce the likelihoods 
# of the alternate analysis shown as the red line on Figure 19 of 
# BICEP/Keck XIII. This likelihood differs from the baseline by varying the 
# parameter A_L (lensing amplitude) as well, with a uniform prior over [0,2.5]. 
# For details of the parameters in the baseline model, see BK18lfonly.ini and 
# BK18lf.ini, and comments therein.
#
# After generating chains, BK18_15_BK18lf_freebdust_freeAl_dist.ini can be 
# used with getdist to produce plots of marginalized posteriors.
