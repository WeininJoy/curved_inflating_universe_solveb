Goal: generate PPS and CMB of the new model (with b).

1. generate_stb_omegak_AsfoH_perm_logA_Ns_logfi_ok__H0.py: code from Lukas 
   (finite_inflation_curved_space_data) to generate PPS using modified primpy (add b). 
2. PPS_Lukas.py: generate PPS following Lukas method [2205.07374] (1) BG evolution based on N_end, 
   (2) set quantum IC by flat RSET
3. PPS_weinin.py: generate PPS and CMB by (1) BG variables depends N_end,
   (2) apply actual numerical b solution to set quantum IC
4. PPS&CMB_will_b.py: generate PPS and CMB by (1) BG variables depends on ns (rather than N_end or N_star),
   (2) apply actual numerical b solution to set quantum IC
   Based on PPS&CMB_willworks.py
5. PPS&CMB_willworks.py: generate PPS and CMB by (1) BG variables depends on ns (rather than N_end or N_star),
   (2) apply Mary's quantum IC [2211.17248]
   Used to make the PPS & CMB plot in [2211.17248]. Based on willworks_origin.py
5. willworks_origin.py: generate PPS&CMB based on Mary's paper [2211.17248]
