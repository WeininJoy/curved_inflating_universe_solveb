1. transformation_SR.nb: solve analytic solutions of 'b' in SR. Note that in SR, solutions of K=1 and K=-1 are the same.
2. transform_K1.nb: solve analytic solutions of 'b' in KD (K=1).
3. transform_K_minus1.nb: solve analytic solutions of 'b' in KD (K=-1).
4. t_to_N.nb: tansform the equation from function of t to N, and try to solve analytic solutions of 'b' in KD (K=-1). 
5. Match_anal_b_KD_SR.nb: try to match analytic solutions of KD and SR (by force).
